# The Merchant

You decide to hear the Merchant’s perspective. Dressed in fine silks, they bow respectfully before speaking.

“The people are struggling,” the Merchant explains. “Trade routes are slowing, and prices are rising. If we help the merchants and citizens now, they will remain loyal to the crown.”

They propose lowering taxes and reopening trade routes to restore confidence in the kingdom.
