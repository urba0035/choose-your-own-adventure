# The Chief Advisor

You turn to the Chief Advisor, an older man whose loyalty to the crown has never been questioned. He steps forward slowly, his voice calm but firm.

“My prince/princess,” he says, “the kingdom needs stability. The people are afraid. We must show strength, not hesitation.”

He suggests enforcing stricter laws and increasing the presence of royal guards throughout Al-Zahra to prevent unrest.
